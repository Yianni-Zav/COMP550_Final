I have a task for you to evaluate a joke using a specific humor rubric. The rubric consists of the following categories, each rated on a scale from 0 to 3:

    Irony (0-3): Rate the use of irony in the joke, where 0 means no irony, 1 means slight irony, 2 means moderate irony, and 3 means the joke is fully ironic.

    Exaggeration (0-3): Evaluate the level of exaggeration, with 0 being none, 1 slight, 2 moderate, and 3 high.

    Wordplay and Puns (0-3): Assess the use of wordplay or puns, where 0 is none, 1 is slight, 2 is moderate, and 3 is extensive.

    Self-Deprecation (0-3): Judge the level of self-deprecation, rating it 0 for none, 1 for slight, 2 for moderate, and 3 for significant.

    Parody and Satire (0-3): Determine the presence and level of parody or satire, with 0 indicating none, 1 slight, 2 moderate, and 3 high.

Additionally, give an overall humor rating:

    Overall Humor (0-3): Rate the overall humor of the joke, where 0 is not funny, 1 is slightly funny, 2 is moderately funny, and 3 is very funny.
